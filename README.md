## Information about the project
It was coded as a fun side project to learn how to use Youtube Data Api. The main website contains actual thumbnails, title of the video, date posted, number of views, and name of the channel. By using sidebar, you can fetch different videos depending on the category you choose. If you click on a thumbnail you will go to the video site on which you will be able to watch the video, read the video description, comments from the users as well as see the recommendations on the right side.
